# MADE WITH PSYCH ENGINE
## BEFORE WE PROCEED
**THIS IS JUST A CRAPPY BAD DONE DEMO, WE ALL HATE THE CODE BUT THATS ALL WE COULD DO TRYING TO FIX NLD'S CODE IN FEW WEEKS WHILE SOME OF US HAD WERE ALREADY IN VACATION; READ DOWN FOR MORE INFOS!!**

## THIS IS A FRIDAY NIGHT FUNKIN' MOD!!!
This project's coding part was originally under the hands of [Nld](https://www.github.com/NLD-Dev) without using any kind of repository or GitHub. Unfortunately though, he hasn't done a good work at all in coding.
He left out of the blue the project for pursuing his roblox carrer, leaving the team right before the final demo release after 8 months of procrastinating.

Besides the fact that he didn't use a github and that his code looks horrific, he also downloaded every libs and started editing them directly, treating them as actual parts of this repository and so I was forced to upload them as source parts if I wanted to keep the whole project (forgive me repositories creators, I swear after the demo releases I won't use this branch anymore).
Searching inside of 10+ repositories what he could have changed is like looking for a needle in the haystack (Update on this: Had the time to check all the libs and now this issue is resolved, no more libs uploaded directly into this repository).

When this version (Demo Build) gets released, we'll redo the whole project inside of Godot from scratch mainly for the reason I've said upper, for tons of optimizations but also because I prefer keeping none of his code knowing what kind of person he is
(talked with the other devs too for knowing).

Good luck on your roblox games i guess Nld.

# Installation and Compiling
Make sure to have haxe at [4.2.5](https://haxe.org/download/version/4.2.5/) (or maybe beyond, haven't tested) and then run these commands in the repository: `haxelib install hmm` (if you haven't installed the `hmm` library already by doing `haxelib install hmm`), `haxelib run hmm install` and then for compiling just `lime test windows` (or other targets instead of windows)!
