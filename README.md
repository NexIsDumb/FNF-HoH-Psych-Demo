# MADE WITH PSYCH ENGINE
## THIS IS A FRIDAY NIGHT FUNKIN' MOD!!!
This project's coding part was originally under the hands of [Nld](https://www.github.com/NLD-Dev) without using any kind of repository or GitHub. Unfortunately though, he hasn't done a good work at all in coding.
He left out of the blue the project for pursuing his roblox carrer, leaving the team right before the final demo release after 8 months of procrastinating.

Besides the fact that he didn't use a github and that his code looks horrific, he also downloaded every libs and started editing them directly, treating them as actual parts of this repository and so I was forced to upload them as source parts if I wanted to keep the whole project (forgive me repositories creators, I swear after the demo releases I won't use this branch anymore).
Searching inside of 10+ repositories what he could have changed is like looking for a needle in the haystack.

When this version (Demo Build) gets released, I'll redo the whole project inside of [Codename Engine](https://github.com/FNF-CNE-Devs/CodenameEngine) from scratch mainly for the reason I've said upper, for tons of optimizations but also because I prefer keeping none of his code knowing what kind of person he is
(talked with the other devs too for knowing).

Good luck on your roblox games i guess Nld.

# Installation
As I said earlier, the modified libs are directly uploaded into this repository so need to reinstall them, all you have to do is having haxe at [4.2.5](https://haxe.org/download/version/4.2.5/) (or maybe beyond, haven't tested).
