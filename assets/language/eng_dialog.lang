Ah, Traveler! You've returned! I could have sworn you had just passed by me a minute ago. You seemed to have dropped this on your way down. Here, take it.
Here, why don't try it out right now? A bit of practice shouldn't do any harm. Besides, I do appreciate the extra company.
I apologize, my singing must be a little rusty. Lets try that again, Traveler.
Traveler, that nail of yours appears to be in quite the sorry state. It won't do you any good down there. Perhaps that charm of yours can be of use to you.
Oh my, I haven't felt such enjoyment in quite a long time!
Oh, It seems we caught the attention of our shopkeep! Perhaps you should pay them a visit? I believe they have might have something that may aid you in your travels.
The couple at the map shop.. Oh, I wish nothing but the best for those two. If only they could have setup shop some place larger.. I can't stand watching the wife bend down to walk through that door, Such a tall bug she is.
The shopkeep? He seems to have everything in that little store of his! I'd be careful if you're looking to purchase from him.. He drives quite a hard bargain for his wares, that bug.
Many used to come in search of a kingdom just below where we stand. Hallownest, it was called. The greatest kingdom there ever was I've been told. It's since become ruin, the sickly air below enough to drive one mad!
You seem exhausted, Traveler. I take it you've ventured down to the leafy caverns below? It's quite a beautiful sight, really.
I suggest you take a rest on that bench before heading out again. I assure you it's quite comfortable.
Oh, I see you've bought from that shopkeep have you? You look quite ready for your next venture. but remember to be careful out there, who knows what you may run into in those caverns.
You seem exhausted, Traveler. Looks like you had put up a hard fight for a bargain.

Ah, Hello! I knew we'd meet again. Seems like you've gotten yourself a bit of a makeover, hm?
Oh, it's been quite some time since I've played like that. I must admit that it was quite enjoyable! As much as it pains me...a battle lost is a battle lost. Here, take your reward and leave me to my Geo.. unless you plan to purchase some more of my wares…
Oh! You wish to sing? Hmm… it's rare for someone to challenge me...
Alright, I accept! I must say that I am not much of a singer myself… but I am curious about your skills.
I’m afraid I have nothing left to offer you. You’ve cleaned me out.
Thank you for your kind patronage! I assure you, my other wares are worth a look at as well! They may even increase your chances at survival down below…
Pockets feeling empty? If you are on the hunt for more geo, the ruins below have much to offer!
