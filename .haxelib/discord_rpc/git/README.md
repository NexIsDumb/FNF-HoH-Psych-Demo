`haxelib git discord_rpc https://github.com/Aidan63/linc_discord-rpc`

## Example Usage

See the test/cli folder for a simple command line program using the externs. For all the options you can pass to the initialize and presence functions remember to check the [Discord-RPC docs](https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/rich-presence/how-to) as the haxe functions mirror the functionality.
