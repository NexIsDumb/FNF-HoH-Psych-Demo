/**
	The SecureSocket class enables code to make socket connections using the
	Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols.

	You can test for support at run time using the `SecureSocket.isSupported`
	property.

	_OpenFL target support:_ This feature is not supported on all platforms.

	_Adobe AIR profile support:_ This feature is supported on all desktop
	operating systems, but is not supported on all AIR for TV devices. On mobile
	devices, it is supported on Android and also supported on iOS starting from
	AIR 20. See
	[AIR Profile Support](https://help.adobe.com/en_US/air/build/WS144092a96ffef7cc16ddeea2126bb46b82f-8000.html)
	for more information regarding API support across multiple profiles.

	The SSL/TLS protocols provide a mechanism to handle both aspects of a secure
	socket connection:

	1. Encryption of data communication over the socket
	2. Authentication of the host's identity via its certificate

	The supported encryption protocols are SSL 3.1 and higher, and TLS 1.0 and
	higher. (TLS is the successor protocol for SSL. TLS 1.0 equals SSL 3.1,
	TLS 1.1 equals SSL 3.2, and so on.) SSL versions 3.0 or lower are not
	supported.

	Validation of the server certificate is performed using the trust store and
	certificate validation support of the client platform. In addition you can
	add your own certificates programmatically with the
	`addBinaryChainBuildingCertificate()` method. This API isn't supported on
	all systems currently. Using this API on some systems will throw an
	exception - "ArgumentError: Error #2004"

	The SecureSocket class only connects to servers with valid, trusted
	certificates. You cannot choose to connect to a server in spite of a problem
	with its certificate. For example, there is no way to connect to a server
	with an expired certificate. The same is true for a certificate that doesn't
	chain to a trusted anchor certificate. The connection will not be made, even
	though the certificate would be valid otherwise.

	The SecureSocket class is useful for performing encrypted communication to a
	trusted server. In other respects, a SecureSocket object behaves like a
	regular Socket object.

	To use the SecureSocket class, create a SecureSocket object
	(`new SecureSocket()`). Next, set up your listeners, and then run
	`SecureSocket.connect(host, port)`. When you successfully connect to the
	server, the socket dispatches a `connec`t event. A successful connection is
	one in which the server's security protocols are supported and its
	certificate is valid and trusted. If the certificate cannot be validated,
	the Socket dispatches an `IOError` event.

	Important: The Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) is not supported by
	all operating systems. Users can also disable OCSP checking on individual
	computers. If OCSP is not supported or is disabled and a certificate does
	not contain the information necessary to check revocation using a
	Certificate Revocation List (CRL), then certificate revocation is not
	checked. The certificate is accepted if otherwise valid. This scenario could
	allow a server to use a revoked certificate.

	@event close            Dispatched when the server closes the socket
							connection.
	@event connect          Dispatched when a network connection has been
							established.
	@event ioError          Dispatched when an input or output error occurs that
							causes a send or receive operation to fail.
	@event securityError    Dispatched when a call to SecureSocket.connect()
							fails because of a security restriction.
	@event socketData       Dispatched when a socket has received data.
