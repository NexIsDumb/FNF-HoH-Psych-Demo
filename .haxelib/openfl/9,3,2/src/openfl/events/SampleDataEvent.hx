/**
	Dispatched when a Sound object requests new audio data or when a
	Microphone object has new audio data to provide.
	This event has two uses:

	* To provide dynamically generated audio data for a Sound object
	* To get audio data for a Microphone object

	**Dynamically generating audio using the Sound object** Use the
	`sampleData` event to play dynamically generated audio. In this
	environment, the Sound object doesn't actually contain sound data.
	Instead, it acts as a socket for sound data that is being streamed to it
	through the use of the function you assign as the handler for the
	`sampleData` event.

	In your function, you use the `ByteArray.writeFloat()` method to write to
	the event's `data`) property, which contains the sampled data you want to
	play.

	If a Sound object has not loaded an MP3 file, when you call its `play()`
	method the object starts dispatching `sampleData` events, requesting sound
	samples. The Sound object continues to send events as the sound plays back
	until you stop providing data, or until the `stop()` method of the
	SoundChannel object is called.

	Thes latency of the event varies from platform to platform, and it could
	change in future versions of Flash Player or AIR. Don't depend on a
	specific latency. Instead calculate it using
	`((SampleDataEvent.position/44.1) - SoundChannelObject.position)`.

	Provide between 2048 and 8192 samples to the `data` property of the
	SampleDataEvent object. For best performance, provide as many samples as
	possible. The fewer samples you provide, the more likely it is that clicks
	and pops will occur during playback. This behavior can differ on various
	platforms and can occur in various situations - for example, when resizing
	the browser. You might write code that works on one platform when you
	provide only 2048 samples, but that same code might not work as well when
	run on a different platform. If you require the lowest latency possible,
	consider making the amount of data user-selectable.

	If you provide fewer than 2048 samples, tha Sound object plays the
	remaining samples and then stops the sound as if the end of a sound file
	was reached, generating a `complete` event.

	You can use the `extract()` method of a Sound object to extract its sound
	data, which you can then write to the dynamic stream for playback.

	When you use the `sampleData` event with a Sound object, the only Sound
	methods that are enabled are `extract()` and `play()`. Calling any other
	methods or properties results in an "invalid call" exception. All methods
	and properties of the SoundChannel object are still enabled.

	**Capturing Microphone audio** Use the `sampleData` event to capture audio
	data from a microphone. When you add an event listener for the
	`sampleData` event, the Microphone dispatches the event as audio samples
	become available.

	In the event handler function, use the `ByteArray.readFloat()` method to
	read the event's `data`) property, which contains the sampled data. The
	event will contain multiple samples, so you should use a `while` loop to
	read the available data:

	```haxe
	var soundBytes = new ByteArray();
	while(event.data.bytesAvailable) {
		var sample = event.data.readFloat();
		soundBytes.writeFloat(sample);
	}
	```
